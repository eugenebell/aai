There was a very helpful receptionist there and I explained my problem, my Grandmother had died and we were trying to contact all of her twelve children, there was just one outstanding, Auntie Norrie in Sydney, who did not have a phone.

I just asked her to hold and I ran up the hall burst into the room where they were waking my grandmother and asked Sean and the other family members present to come quickly, they all did.

So a few days later they stripped the tyres off the two motorbikes and put one motorbike on each rail track.  The wheel rims gripped the rail tracks and held them steady.  So, the two of them got up on the motorbikes and had their races.</p><br><p>It's at this point that the stories branched out, each of them claiming that they had won the race.
